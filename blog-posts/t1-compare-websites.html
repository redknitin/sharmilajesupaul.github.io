      <h4>Comparing Websites</h4>

      <p>Listed below are 3 of my favorite websites, and by 'favorite' I mean, the websites that I think do a good job of providing me with a user experience that never disappoints. I also chose these sites because I believe that they give back to the community in a variety of ways. Kongregate, my first listed site is a hub for independent game designers. Instructables allows people to share any DIY skill or technique in the form of a tutorial. And lastly, the New York Times, a news source which I have been religiously perusing since 2004. One thing that all of these sites have in common, are the capability to give feedback on any kind of content.</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.kongregate.com">Kongregate</a>: Kongregate is a large online games hosting website. Unlike Steam and Origin, a majority of Kongregate games are indie web-browser games created by users. Kongregate allows users to upload user-created Adobe Flash, HTML 5/JavaScript, Shockwave, Java or Unity3D games for free. Users can also provide feedback on all content, which creates for a dynamic developer community.
        </li>

        <p>
         Kongregate is one of my favorite websites partly because of the user generated content, i.e. the games themselves. The other reason is user experience. In the past year, the user experience on Kongregate has evolved from a basic achievement and leveling system, to having a trophy system in the form of small animals called <a href=“http://www.kongregate.com/kongpanions”>Kongpanions</a> (sometimes they're objects and even food... like Starsky up there). Users can collect Kongpanions by completing daily achievements, you can even collect ‘shiny’ Kongpanions when you complete more than 4 daily achievements a week. Its amazing that the team at Kongregate really knows how to create a website that encourages users to spend time browsing and playing a wide array of indie games, while being constantly ‘rewarded’ for adding content, providing feedback, and playing the games themselves.
        </p>

      <p>
        When I look at Kongregate's index page, I my eyes are immediately drawn to a large auto-scrolling “Featured” box on the left side of the screen. Adjacent to that box, is a list of trending games. The site also recommends games that your friends have played (yes, you can also add other users as friends). If I had to describe the visual aspects of the website in 5 words, they would be: entertaining, dynamic, tabular, involved, and injected with social media integration. That last one might not be an adjective, but I tried my best.
     </p>

      <p>
        As I mentioned before, Kongregate creates an immersive user experience through ‘metagaming’. Kongregate also provides a safe setting for novice and independent game developers to host games and receive feedback. Many of the developers on Kongregate have start by creating small flash based browser games. Eventually their games are enlarged and improved and then released on Steam -- <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/superflashbros/haunt-the-house">Haunt the House </a> is a recent example of this. Kongregate’s focus and content is voluminous, immersive, organized, versatile, and eventful (lots of daily and weekly events occur). Although there is a large amount of links and tables on the index page. It is quite easy to navigate. Two factors that make this possible are spacing and the use of images. Kongrate also allows you to create an account by linking to a Facebook page. This allows users to bypass the user registration form. So I would say, the webpage is fairly easy to navigate and the search has improved dramatically over the years. Kongregate’s search now allows users to filter by user-rating, popularity, tags, achievements, and many other things (I think you can also earn medals, playing cards, in-game items, and whole plethora of other miscellaneous items). When I’m on Kongregate I feel relaxed, but sometimes I am much too absorbed (its like a drug). Especially when my friends are online and we play together.

      <p>
        Lastly, Kongregate does have an in-site called Kreds (are you tired of all the Ks yet? Kardashian Khloe Kim Kendall Kongpanions…. I bet you’re tired of it now). Kreds are used to donate to developers as well as in game purchases in a select number of games. I have purchased Kreds before, they were a gift for a friend of mine, who plays <a href=“http://www.kongregate.com/games/SpiralKnights/spiral-knights?acomplete=spira”>Spiral Knights</a> obsessively, he uses the Kreds to buy ‘energy’ in the game, which subsequently allows him to complete more in-game quests.

      <li>
        <a href="http://www.instructables.com">Instructables</a>: Instructables is a website specializing in user-created and uploaded do-it-yourself projects, which other users can comment on and rate for quality.
      </li>

      <p>
        Instructables is another one of my favorite websites for the fact that I can find almost any how-to guide, ranging from recipes to programming arduino boards. On the index page, my eyes are immediately drawn to the giant animated featured box in the center of the page. Its so huge and colorful that I don’t even want to a add a sample image here, you should just click on the link to see it in action. I would describe the Instructables homepage as vibrant, modern, symmetrical, picturesque, and captivating.
      </p>

      <p>
        When it comes to focus and purpose, Instructables provides a large database of tutorials and allows users to give feedback. They also host events, such as various contests for DIY enthusiasts. Instructables helps spark creativity showing users ideas similar to the initial search and you can even bookmark them. The Instructables community also highlights a largely diverse group of DIY tutorials. They promote everything from common household fixes (like how to load a dishwasher) to large almost industrial development (like instructions on how to laser cut shapes). Having one database encompass and celebrate such a wide array of talents is quite heart warming.

      <br>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</a>: More specifically, the website that hosted the popular American daily newspaper, founded and continuously published in New York City.
      </li>

      <p>
        I have been a NYTimes reader for my most of my life, let me explain why: I was continuously encouraged, by my teachers and professors to keep up with current events. And I was interested in scientific articles and mimicking technical writing. When I wanted to find something accurately technical, easy to read, and still relevant to today’s events — the first place I searched was the NYTimes science section. This website has provided me with years of insight, paper topics, suggestions on books to read, etc. And even today, years later, I still venture over to read about current events and even see short but powerful op-ed documentaries. Visually, the New York Times index page stays true to its brand name. And by this, I mean, it gives you the feel of the front page of a busy newspaper, using tables and block arrangement of articles. The difference is, you can click on the articles and they expand onto a new page in full length view, along with comments. The New York Times presents content in a coherent way and there is tons of materials to read. One new implementation, to my dismay, is the dreaded Paywall. The paywall limited users to reading 10 articles per month, without a subscription to the New York Times. But thankfully, there is one caveat: Social Media. Thanks to the large influx of social media integration any articles that are redirected from social media sites like Twitter and Facebook override the paywall. This means that you can click on and read as many articles you like, as long as you find the link on a social media network. This limits your articles to whatever is posted on Social Media but this is better than having to pay for a subscription. This is where I choose my NYTimes Science articles now: https://www.facebook.com/nytimesscience. </p>
