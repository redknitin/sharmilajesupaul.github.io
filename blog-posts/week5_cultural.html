            <h2>Pairing and Feedback</h2><h4>during weeks 1-5 of Phase 0</h4>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h5><strong>Pair Programming:</strong></h5>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pair programming regularly is a practice that was completely new to me before the start of Phase 0, so diving into this new way of working has definitely taught me a lot. During one of my toughest pairing sessions, I noticed the singular emotion that made me feel unsure of myself, it was the feeling of <em>inadequacy</em>. I love thinking through logic out-loud, and in this particular pairing session, I felt like I was interfering when I tried to communicate. I felt like my way of thinking was not enough. I felt uncomfortably inadequate. My partner had a completely different approach, and I wasn’t able to adapt to the change very easily. In hindsight, I wish I had talked more about what our interpretations of the driver and navigator roles were. We really did not see eye to eye on what our expectations were making some of the harder challenges especially frustrating. 
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about an hour of long awkward pauses, excessive inquiries, and half baked suggestions (all of which were coming from me). We had some code written out and we were headed in the right direction. Thats when things became simpler, we refactored to our hearts content and made a flexible, well-structured program. But I still couldn’t get over that feeling of inadequacy. 
            </p>

            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought about the situation some more. And then it hit me. I need to speak up and advocate for my own approach to solving a problem. I enjoy figuring out every step of logic in plain english because it lets me know that I know how to solve the problem before attempting to write code. This might differ among others, but I wish that I had stuck to my gut and insist on walking through things. Even if it might add 15-20 minutes to our pairing sessions. 
            </p>

            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tense moments where my pair and I eagerly listen to each other’s ideas in the hopes that we can come to a conclusion, is almost always followed by a giddy celebratory feeling when we’ve found an elegant and accurate algorithm. I love that feeling and I have felt it a number of times during phase 0. Pair programming is a fun away to come together and bounce ideas off each other. I learn so much from my other classmates and I learn even more by teaching what I know to others. Walking someone through a method makes me prove that I know what I am doing. Overall, I am grateful that I have had the chance to get to know so many wonderfully unique thinkers even before setting foot in DBC San Francisco. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5><strong>Feedback:</strong></h5>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my interview for DBC, I was told that feedback is very important part of the program. I also read about the importance of feedback in the FAQ section of the website, the application, in articles, blog posts, basically everywhere I looked. I have to admit, I was more scared than excited about receiving feedback from the instructors as well as my peers. But what I quickly realized was that the more feedback I received, the more aware I became of what I need to improve. I was forced to reflect on how each interaction was made and how it could have been done better. Most of my feedback contained a running theme, the lack of explicit discussion about working style and other logistics. In most of my early pairing sessions, I would never explicitly discuss how I interpreted the driver-navigator roles. We would often decide who takes on what role and jump into the problem. Skipping this step caused me to run into the issue discussed in the pairing section above. I realized that the idea of what the driver and navigator does is slightly different for everyone and I should take the time to discuss our thoughts. 

            </p>

            <p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I had to learn the hard way, was how to give Actionable, Specific, and Kind feedback. I am a naturally encouraging person, I believe that we all have immense capability that we have yet to tap into. I have no problem leaving kind or specific feedback. But when it came to being actionable, I was completely lost. I felt guilty about the fact that I had to suggest how others can improve, while being a very imperfect beginner myself. But then I realized that some of the best feedback I have received has only helped me because of the direct actionable piece of advice. Actionable feedback helps me take a second look at something I may not have noticed about myself. When someone lets me know that I was saying too much, too quickly, or moving too fast — the next time around, I know that I need to slow down and check in with my pair more often. And that makes for an extremely successful pairing session. These days when I write my feedback, instead of berating myself about how I shouldn’t be looking for flaws, I think about what could have genuinely improved our session. An idea I can store and use as a tool for next time. 
           </p>

           <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall,  I think feedback has helped me achieve much more productive and enjoyable pairing sessions. It has made me realize that we are all in this program together, and we all want to know how to do things in the best way possible. I am also really thankful for this awesome group of coders who know exactly how to lend a helping hand when they see someone struggling. Its makes me feel safe, like I know where to go if I am struggling. I also have let go and exposed my ignorance a lot more because I feel like that is the only way to learn and grow. Pairing and Feedback making for a dynamic and immersive experience during Phase 0 and I am so glad I took the plunge.
