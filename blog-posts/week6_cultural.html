            <h2>Identity Contingencies and the Stereotype Threat</h2>
            <br>

            <h4><strong>Identity Contingency:</strong></h4>
            <p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identity contingency is a the personal awareness and internalization of group identity that arises on a situational basis. What this means is, in some situations, certain identities (whether it’s race, gender, sexual orientation, age, etc) are amplified. In other situations, this identity is not observed. As an child of immigrant parents growing up in New Jersey at a very young age, I carry a strong vivid memory of a conversation that made me realize that I had a cultural identity. One of my best friends in first grade, a girl named Eleanor, turned to me and asked, “Where is your family from?”. “We’re Indian”, I replied quickly. She smiled and nodded like she completely understood and then asked “So do you live in a teepee?”. I was extremely confused, and Eleanor was too as soon as corrected her, “Not that kind of Indian” I said. What happened after was a series of strange questions “Why do Indian people where togas?(she meant saris)”, “Why do Indian people talk funny?”, “Why do Indian people eat weird food?”. The questions were innocent but endless and they confirmed one thing: my cultural identity was very different from Eleanor’s. This situation made me acutely aware of one particular identity contingency. 
            </p>

            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I grew older, I spent several years at a boarding school in Coimbatore, India. My identity at the school in India was turned upside down. No longer was I seen as an Indian; I was seen as one of the American students at the school. Interestingly enough, you would think being surrounded by people of the same cultural background would remove the discomfort of racism and discrimination; but in reality, the racism had morphed into being color-ism and discrimination based on locational upbringing. I wasn’t being judged on the basis of being Indian anymore, I was being judged for being darker skinned than others or based on where in India my family is from (or even, what language we speak). No matter how illogical or unnecessary these assumptions might seem, they still contributed to a sense of identity contingency that is impossible to ignore. The premise of my identity contingencies continually changed from moment to moment. These identities only exist in context and are unavoidable and unique to each individual. They can dictate the choices we make when it comes to careers, relationships, where we live, etc. Unfortunately, identity contingencies that threaten us are often the most gripping.

            <h4><strong>Stereotype Threat:</strong></h4>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a Java Programming course at the University of California, Santa Cruz my professor announced that he was organizing a women only trip to the Google headquarters. A couple hands shot up, and then a male student stood up and asked ‘why women only? we want to go too.” My professor, who was the head of the computer science department with years in the field, answered “look around and notice how many girls are in this class”. Thats when I felt it, over a hundred pairs of eyes fell directly on the small group of six women sitting together in the middle of the lecture hall. After the lecture was over, there were groups of male students expressing anger for the fact that they weren’t allowed to go on the trip. “Women aren’t serious about this anyway” I overheard someone say, “I always have to explain things to them, its annoying”. The debates were loud, negative, and quite honestly, very discouraging. It felt like the students in the class didn’t want us there. Us being “women” in this situation. And not surprisingly, the next day of class, we were down to three women including myself. I’m not exactly sure why those other girls dropped the class but I started to lose faith in my own ability to program. I felt like I was having a hard time with Java because I was at a disadvantage based on my own gender.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the situation described above, a stereotype reared its head and became a plausible explanation of my struggles. And quite frankly it is a more acceptable to blame things on uncontrollable factors, such as gender, than admitting that it was due to my own anxiety and lack of preparation. Researchers have found that when when the stereotype threat exists and your identity contingency is being threatened, you are less likely to perform as well as students who do not face the same stereotype threat. Meaning that the results confirm the stereotype threat.
            </p>

            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kl4bjdff6tvmx7p/brown%26day.pdf?dl=0">study</a> conducted by Brown and Day in 2006, used the <a href="http://www.raventest.net/">Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices</a> (APM) task to determine whether achievement gap is correlational to the existence of a stereotype threat. African-American and White undergraduates completed the APM after being given three different types of instructions: 
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Standard instructions: that "the APM is a measure of observation and clear thinking"</li>
              <li>High threat instructions: that it "is an IQ test...frequently used to measure individuals’ intelligence and ability” (stereotype threat for African-Americans). </li>
              <li>Low threat instructions: that it "is a series of puzzles".</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Each instructional category produced predicable results:</p>
            <center><img src="../imgs/brown_and_day_data.png" /></center>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The values in the graph above can be slightly confusing. The ‘M’ stands for mean of all test scores, SD is standard deviation, and the d<sup>a</sup> is the mean for whites minus the mean for African Americans (i.e. M<sub>Whites</sub> - M<sub>AfricanAms</sub>). When that number (d<sup>a</sup>) is negative, the test score mean of African American students is surpassing the test score mean of the White students. This data depicts ACT scores, AMP scores (Raw and Adjusted), test accuracy, and items attempted in situations where a low, standard, and high stereotype threat is present. 
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look closely at the raw AMP scores, the black students seem to underperform when a high stereotype threat is present (when the APM was described to be a test of intelligence). But they did slightly better than the white students when a low stereotype threat was present (when the APM was described as a series of puzzles). What this data confirms is that stereotype threat does effect achievement gap. 
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renowned psychologist, Claude M Steele offers wonderful advice on how to give feedback that ensures the removal of a stereotype threat. He says in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">lecture </a>at Columbia University, that when a student is told that they personally have the ability to achieve something there is a sense safety. Moreover, the positive feedback can encourage a student to do well for years to come. This sense of safety can be achieved through leadership and normative influence. When leaders positively encourage diversity, identity contingencies are safe and stronger inter-cultural relationships are formed. When the corrections in outlook and language begin to change on a leadership level, it ripples its way to the general mass, a greater sense of belongingness is possible to achieve by taking the right steps towards keeping identity contingencies safe.
