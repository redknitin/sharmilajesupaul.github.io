        <h3>A Quick Overview of JavaScript</h3>

        <p>
          I had a lot of prior misconceptions about Javascript before actively researching and learning the language. The largest misconception that I have come across, even among some seasoned programmers, is that Javascript has anything to do Java. I’ve been told that Javascript is built on Java, Javascript is similar to Java, and a bunch of other things that can be misleadingly inferred from two languages sharing the name ‘Java’. Despite all of these misconceptions, JavaScript is one of the most popular client-side scripting languages used today. What this means is JavaScript can be executed on the the ‘client-side’, the user’s web browser, instead of on the web server (or server-side). JavaScript also helps keep the web interactive and dynamic; new features are rapidly developed and improved, resulting in a well constructed user experience on multiple platforms.
        </p>
        <p><strong>JavaScript: Emergence and Naming </strong></p>
        <p>
          During the Browser Wars in the late 1990’s, Microsoft created Internet Explorer which was thought to replace Netscape’s Navigator. Their rivalry was intense. Both companies began to add more and more client-side scripting tools to promote their browser as the dominant one. Among all the rapid development, new features were added routinely, including JavaScript, which was originally developed by Netscape. Microsoft also replicated JavaScript, their version is called JScript. We could say that the victor of the Browser Wars was Microsoft, since IE eventually replaced Navigator. But their win was short-lived because from 2003 onwards a collection of emerging browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera have eroded Microsoft’s dominance over the market. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So why the name JavaScript? According to Marijn Haverbeke, the author of ‘Eloquent Javascript’, the answer is simple and anti-climatic.
        </p>
        <blockquote><p>
          "The similar name was inspired by marketing considerations, rather than good judgment. When JavaScript was being introduced, the Java language was being heavily marketed and was gaining in popularity. Someone thought it a good idea to try to ride along on this success. Now we are stuck with the name” (Haverbeke Intro).
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>
          Since Java was the popular language at the time, I guess the marketing team wanted to clearly point out that JavaScript is as versatile and flexible as Java. JavaScript is implemented in all popular browsers today, adapting the script to work outside of the Netscape browser called for a rewriting of the original standard document. The new standards were written and implemented by the ECMA organization (European Computer Manufacturers Association). This is called the EMCAScript standard; the terms ‘EMCAScript’ and ‘JavaScript’ can be used interchangeably - they are essentially two names for the same language. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Popularity in Web Development</strong></p>
        <p>Four words: High. Performance. Web. Applications. If you think about all the web applications that you use today, they are known to provide a great user experience by constantly improving and adding functionality. Mobile platforms are more important now than ever before, they are beginning to dominate the market. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/28/technology/mobile/mobile-apps-internet/">Check out the statistics</a>. Javascript has several frameworks, such as node.js, that is used to build applications that can respond very quickly and efficiently to a high volume of incoming requests. Another large contributing factor, is JavaScript’s best friend: HTML5. HTML has long been the skeleton of the web. Its the language that makes up every single web page, and coupled with CSS, we have the skin and make-up of the web page. Javascript is the third factor, it is the lighting that brings our web page to life. It adds interactivity and makes it easy to integrate complex websites with several features on multiple platforms. Together, HTML5/CSS3 and JavaScript, create an interactive, more dynamic, user experience on the web. JavaScript has several advantages, it is executed on the client-side, which means it can be executed using any local desktop processor and doesn’t have to be executed on a web server, this saves bandwidth and strain on the web server. It adds functionality to web pages, its relatively easy to learn, and its fast.  </p> 
        <p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
        <p>JavaScript is a very useful tool, but it also has several limitations. Javascipt is still inconsistent in terms of functionality and interface. Although, most web developers today (at least, the good ones), pay close attention to standardizing code so that it has a uniform rendering across platforms. JavaScript is also becoming more standardized, there are still some inconsistencies. Check out <a href="https://air.mozilla.org/typedevil-dynamic-type-inconsistency-analysis-for-javascript">this source</a> that outlines several type inconsistencies in JavaScript. Another limiting factor is security, JavaScript is entirely open source so the snippets can be easily accessed by other users; even the encrypted or hidden snippets can be accessed by malicious code. JavaScript cannot access web pages hosted on a different domain, which means you cannot access files that belong to a different domain. It also cannot access databases or write to files on the servers. </p>
