        <h3>Problems in the Tech Industry</h3>
        <p>
          Talking about what is wrong with the tech industry is difficult when you are aspiring to be a part of it. I must admit, it can be discouraging to dig through pages of documents articulately explaining that someone of my background and gender should expect to be marginalized in the workforce. Back in July, I came across the Whitney Wolfe sexual harassment <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-07-02/tinders-forgotten-woman-whitney-wolfe-sexism-and-startup-creation-myths">case</a> against Tinder. As the case progressed more documents were released and it became clear that Wolfe was facing extremely unprofessional behavior at her workplace. I also came across a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/19/5526574/github-sexism-scandal-julie-ann-horvath">similar situation</a> at GitHub, Julie Ann Horvath was the first developer to quit her job at the company because of the way she was being treated. Many of these stories involve women who are put in an uncomfortable situation because they aren’t fulfilling the skewed expectation (which is often rooted in over feminized subordination) unfairly placed on them by their peers and employers. It is apparent that these problems are due to the lack of women in the tech industry. Since there are so few women, we are automatically seen as an  outlier rather than a fellow peer. <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/this-is-why-there-arent-enough-women-in-tech-1221929631">This</a> harrowing compilation on Gawker: ValleyWag portrays testimony after testimony of women being treated unfairly in tech.

        <p>
          The other issue, that goes hand-in-hand with the lack of women in tech, is the overuse of “culture fit”. Finding a workplace with a culture that you respect is important. Especially when it comes down to workplace ethics, pacing, and how most interactions are handled between peers. But it seems like ‘culture fit’ is being interpreted as a way to marginalize qualified people that may have a different view or outlook than the currently employed team. Shanley Kane’s blog post titled <a href="http://betabeat.com/2013/02/what-your-culture-really-says-shanley-kane-toxic-lies-afoot-in-silicon-valley/">“What Your Culture Really Says: The Toxic Lies Afoot in Silicon Valley”</a> is illuminative of the misleading interpretations of work culture. She mentions that teams who boast about making sure to hire people who are a cultural fit, often use the term 'culture' as a way to ensure homogeneity in the workforce. In her ironically exaggerated example, she states: “…We are able to reject qualified, diverse candidates on the grounds that they “aren’t a culture fit” while not having to examine what that means – and it might mean that we’re all white, mostly male, mostly college-educated, mostly young/unmarried, mostly binge drinkers, mostly from a similar work background”. Pretending like the problem doesn’t exist, doesn’t make it disappear. Whether its diversity, gender, economic status, or any other dividing factor between people, there is an expectation of discrimination. But to become aware of those problems and openly talk about how to get past them is taking one step closer to erasing those lines.
        </p>
        <p> Here's a poignant excerpt from Kane’s post: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Culture is not about the furniture in your office. It is not about how much time you have to spend on feel-good projects. It is not about catered food, expensive social outings, internal chat tools, your ability to travel all over the world, or your never-ending self-congratulation.</p>

          <p>Culture is about power dynamics, unspoken priorities and beliefs, mythologies, conflicts, enforcement of social norms, creation of in/out groups and distribution of wealth and control inside companies. Culture is usually ugly. It is as much about the inevitable brokenness and dysfunction of teams as it is about their accomplishments. Culture is exceedingly difficult to talk about honestly. The critique of startup culture that came in large part from the agile movement has been replaced by sanitized, pompous, dishonest slogans.”</p>
