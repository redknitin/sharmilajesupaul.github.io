        <h4>Phase 0 Week 1: Cultural Blog Post</h4>

      <p> Let me start with the most cliche but most instinctive reaction I had to <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shareef’s Fireside Chat</a> — I am so excited to start creating and building awesome things at Dev Bootcamp! (I had to delete a couple exclamations at the end of that statement) Heres another thing: I wish I understood the Kitchen vs. Restaurant mindset during my undergraduate studies. I went through my university education trying to appease my family and I never really “owned my education”. I studied and I prepared for tests and I was ultimately validated in my actions and choices, by being rewarded by a good grade. It was robotic, methodical, corrupt, rigid, and automatic; I deeply felt like something was missing and it was passion. </p>

      <p>Before doing my undergrad at UCSC, I went through a very unconventional K-12 education. I spent my elementary years in public school in New Jersey. I was a handful. I was loud, boisterous, and very unruly as a child. By the time I reached the fourth grade, my parents decided I needed to be taught discipline in a different setting. I was sent a military boarding school in India to be taught how to ’respect my elders’, ‘not talk back’, and ‘learn to act like a girl’ (my parents and I have had many conversations about this). After a couple years in India, I attended an all girls high-school in Western Massachusetts. There was something about the culture shock combined with a sudden amount of freedom to speak my mind, that just changed my entire outlook on life. But I didn’t stop changing there, I met a wonderful people during my university. I realized how much more wisdom I extracted from my professors outside the lecture hall.
      </p>

      <p>I wanted to fill you in on my educational background because it is a large part of my life. I am still extremely passionate about reforming public education because we have been doing it the same way for the past 150 years. While our culture and lifestyle has changed in unthinkable ways. Before applying to Dev Bootcamp I worked for Rocketship Education Brilliant Minds, a charter school that uses a longer, more immersive curriculum to instruct elementary school students. This also included the encouragement of the use of technology in the classroom, tutoring, home visits with student’s families, and mandatory parental participation. What really drew me to Rocketship is the dynamic community passionately working towards something very important for the public school system: trying to eliminate the achievement gap. This brings me to Dev Bootcamp, that thrives on our motivation and hunger to create and enrich ourselves as well as each other. I am so hungry for a hands on environment, I am excited to be in a classroom that everybody wants to be in. I’m excited to actively participate, to bounce ideas off incredibly unique and complex individuals, I am excited to finally be immersed in education with passion.
      </p>

      <p>But don’t get me wrong, I am SO nervous. I have to intentionally stop myself from thinking “What if I have to repeat a phase?”, “What if I am kicked out?”, “What if nobody likes my point of view?”, “What if I am not am not as creative as I think I am?”…. these thoughts have been driving me crazy. But after venting at one of my closest friends, he said something that has offered me solace. I want to share this with you because, if you’re anywhere as anxious as I am, I hope this brings you some solace as well. While my heart pounded under the weight of my thoughts challenging my own capability, he calmly asked me “Would you say that you know more now, than… a month ago?”. I didn’t have to think about my answer “Of course, I know way more now”. This was an ‘aha moment’ and I realized just as he began to speak again, “You just proved that you have the capability to learn. Of course there’s going to be things you don’t know at the program, but you are more than capable to put in the work and learn them and you have already proved that to yourself ”. To my overly anxious and skeptical self, this moment was huge. I finally realized that as long as I give this everything I’ve got, wring out every drop of my creativity, something beautiful can come of this experience. I believe this for every single member of my cohort, together, we are so much more capable and powerful and I am sincerely grateful for having this opportunity. </p>
