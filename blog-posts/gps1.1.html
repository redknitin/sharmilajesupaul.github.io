      <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
      <p>
        When two people work on the same piece of code. 
      </p>
      
      <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
      <p>
        Emmanuel: It makes the students work harder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sharmila: Social training for programming.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
      <p> 
        Emmanuel: The driver is on the keyboard and the navigator is not on the keyboard, 
        but they contribute equally towards writing and discussing code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sharmila: The driver is in the car driving and the navigator is like Siri, telling the 
        driver where to look and when to turn.
