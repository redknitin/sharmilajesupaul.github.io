        <h3>Thinking Style, Time Management, and Other Things I Can Improve</h3>
        <img src="../imgs/gregorc.png">
        <p>
          ↑ You’re probably thinking to yourself ‘Does that graph up there even mean anything?’. Well, it probably means nothing to you, but it does mean something to me. And those of you who have already created similar <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc Thinking Style</a> graphs probably noticed that I switched some of the labels around.
        </p>
        <p>
          This graph represents a change in my thinking style over the last 2 months. I laid both of the ‘abstract’ categories along the x axis so that you can see how my thinking has gone from a culmination at the abstract extremes, to a relatively more even shape. This is the funny thing about tests geared towards assessing your personality; we are continuously changing as people from moment to moment. So there really isn’t one label or set of data that can we can define ourselves by. That being said, I am still leaning towards Abstract Random (even though my score has gone down from 40 to 24). I will address this after I describe the struggles I have endured during Phase 0. </p>

          <p>By the way, writing out all the solutions to the Gregorc Thinking Style quiz is a total pain. A DBC alum created a simple ruby program to help calculate your thinking style: <a href="https://github.com/Devbootcamp/gregorc">Check it out</a>.</p>
